# Exploring Emotional Response to Social Media

## About
This project explores which factors are strongly associated with emotional responses to social media usage. It analyzes a survey-based dataset from Kaggle to examine how demographics, usage patterns, and social interactions relate to users' dominant emotions.

## Files
- `Analysis Report.pdf` — Full written report with findings and visualizations
- `Analysis code.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with all data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations

## Methods
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (grouped by gender, emotion, platform)
- Data visualization (bar charts, box plots, scatter plots)
- One-way ANOVA test

## Key Findings
- Users experiencing happiness tend to spend more time on social media and post more frequently
- There is a statistically significant difference in daily usage time across emotion groups (p < 0.05)
- A positive linear relationship exists between daily usage time and total interactions
- Female users tend to spend more time online and receive more interactions
